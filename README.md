# automan
this one's just a random project of mine, had a thought one day, so here we are

## status
I've got to do some learning before diving into it, so currently on hold

## to implement
web API - for dictionary and possibly safety checks
GUI - so it's nice to use, alternatively, could make it a CLI-based game
ML - to allow it to play competitively (or by itself, if the user enjoys 0-player games...)
